# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

Originally, HTML was created only to structure content — headings, paragraphs, links. That’s it.

But people started abusing it to control design:
<font> for colors
<center> for alignment
Tables for layout
Inline styles everywhere

-> The result?
Messy, duplicated code. Every visual change required editing every page manually.

Then CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was introduced to separate:
## HTML → Structure (what it is)
## CSS → Presentation (how it looks)
That separation changed everything.

### Why CSS made it easier:
- One change affects everything
- Change a color in one CSS file → every page updates.
- Cleaner HTML
- No more cluttered <font> tags and inline styling.

- Consistency: Design stays uniform across the entire site.
Maintainability: Teams can scale projects without chaos.
Powerful layout systems: Flexbox, Grid — impossible with pure HTML tables without headache.
