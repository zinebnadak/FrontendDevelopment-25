<!--
XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a structured format used to store and transport data.

The rules of HTML comes from XML but XML is not a markup language like HTML.
It is a meta-language, which means it allows you to create your own custom tags to define the structure and meaning of your data.

Unlike HTML, which focuses on displaying content in a browser, XML focuses on organizing data
in a clear, hierarchical structure using custom-defined tags.

Key ideas:
- XML describes data, not presentation.
- Tags are user-defined (you create the names).
- Data is structured in nested elements (parent → child).
- It is both human-readable and machine-readable.

Purpose:
To separate data from application logic and presentation, allowing systems to exchange
information in a standardized and structured way.
