<!--
ANTI-DIRECTORY LISTING (Development / Structure Control)

This file prevents the server from displaying a list of files
when someone accesses this folder directly (e.g. /scripts/ or /images/).

Web servers automatically load "index.html" when entering a folder.
By placing this file here, we stop the browser from showing
a directory listing of files (such as .js, images, etc.).

This page immediately redirects back to the root index.html.

IMPORTANT:
- This does NOT protect files from direct access.
- If someone knows the exact file path (e.g. /scripts/app.js),
  they can still access it.
- This only prevents folder content listing in the browser.

Remove or modify if server-side directory listing is disabled.
