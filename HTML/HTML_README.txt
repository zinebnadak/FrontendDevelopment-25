PROJECT OVERVIEW
Internal Website – HTML Course Assignment

Description:
This project consists of building a complete internal (intranet-style) website for the fictional company Tricell Laboratories. The assignment is based on learning classic HTML structure and understanding how multi-page websites were built before modern CSS and frameworks existed.

The project is divided into two main folders:
1. IT25-22_intern_website → My actual, customized project
2. intern_website → A clean template with reusable structure

-----------------------------------------
1. IT25-22_intern_website (Main Project)
-----------------------------------------
This folder contains the final version of the internal website.
It includes all required pages, customized content, images, and layout according to the instructions from my teacher.

Main pages:
- index.html
- IT25-22.html (employee profile pages)
- personnel_registry.html
- company_presentation.html
- history.html
- board_of_directors.html

Required layout features:
- Header with social media icons and company contact information
- Navigation menu placed below the header
- Back button for returning to index.html
- Text headers moved inside the info-box instead of above
- Removal of green bars from the original design
- Additional information pages about the company

Learning goals:
- Working with classic HTML structures such as <table> and <font>
- Creating multi-page navigation with internal links
- Organizing files in a structured project folder
- Understanding how older websites were built without CSS

This folder represents the final version I hand in.

-----------------------------------------
2. intern_website (Template Folder)
-----------------------------------------
This folder is a clean skeleton version of the project.
It contains simplified versions of the pages, layout notes, and comments explaining how the structure works.

Purpose:
- To provide a reusable base for future internal websites
- To store explanations for myself about each part of the layout
- To separate the learning template from the final project
- To practice good developer habits (templates, documentation, clean structure)

The template includes:
- A blank index.html structure
- Template layout files for secondary pages
- Notes about the header, menu, tables, and info-boxes
- Example icons and image placeholders

-----------------------------------------
Technical Notes
-----------------------------------------
The project uses intentionally old HTML techniques:
- <table> for layout instead of CSS
- <font> tags for styling text
- Inline attributes (bgcolor, valign, align, border…)
These methods help build foundational understanding of HTML before using modern CSS.

-----------------------------------------
Summary
-----------------------------------------
This project demonstrates:
- Folder structure organization
- Classic HTML page construction
- Internal linking between multiple pages
- Interpretation of teacher instructions
- Ability to customize, layout, and document a complete multi-page website

The template folder supports learning and future practice, while the IT25-22_intern_website folder contains the final completed assignment.
