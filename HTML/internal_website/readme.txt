Internal Website Structure

Description:
This folder contains a clean, reusable template for building internal (intranet-style) websites. It acts as a reference and skeleton structure that I can use for future school projects or experiments.

Purpose:
To store a generalised version of the Tricell layout, including comments, explanations, and reusable structure. Developers often keep template folders like this to speed up future work.

Contains:
- A blank index.html template
- Template versions of secondary pages (company_presentation, history, board_of_directors, personnel_registry)
- Notes explaining how the layout works
- A clean folder structure for images, icons, and layout elements

Concept: What is an internal website?
- A small intranet-style website used within a company (fictional: Tricell).
- Not published on the real internet.
- Stored locally as HTML files linking to each other.

Common internal pages:
- Employee directory
- Company history
- Contact details
- Documents or presentations

HTML techniques used in the template:
- Table-based layout (<table>)
- <font> tags for styling
- No CSS
These methods are intentionally old-school to understand classic HTML, page structure, and how sites were built before CSS became standard.

Notes:
This template folder is NOT my project. It is a clean skeleton intended for practice, documentation, and future reuse.
