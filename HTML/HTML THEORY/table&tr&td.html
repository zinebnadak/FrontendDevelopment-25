<!--  How You Form Layout Using Tables -->
<!--
You do this:
1. Create a main table = the entire frame
2. Create a row
3. Decide how many columns that row should have
4. Put content inside each <td>

Before you write code, ask yourself.
If necessary, draw it on paper first. If you can visualize the grid, your HTML will not break.
- How many rows do I need?
- How many columns are in each row?
- What goes inside each cell?
-->

<table border = "1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>                       <!-- new row -->
       <td width="50"> </td>   <!-- each td adds a column/cell 50px wide, columns go inside tr (rows) -->
       <td width="50" height ="50"> </td> <!-- height ="50" affects ALL columns/cells, since all cells in a row share the same row, they must share the same height. Browser silently repairs mistakes -->
       <td width="50"> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>                       <!-- second row -->
        <td width="50"> </td>  <!-- one column -->
        <td width="50" height ="10"> </td>
        <td width="50"> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>                       <!-- third row -->
        <td colspan="3" height="50"> </td> <!-- colspan contols width , This cell stretches horizontally across 3 columns, So its width is already determined by those columns -->
    </tr>
</table>

<!-- Stop thinking in “rows and cells. Start thinking in coordinates. -->
<!--
Now we have created:
| (1,1) | (1,2) | (1,3) |
| (2,1) | (2,2) | (2,3) |
|    (3,1)(3,2)(3,3)    |   single cell occupies all three
-->

<!-- Now we use rowspan, but when you give rowspan a number you need to already have enough of that num of many rows eg. tr:s -->
<table border="1">
<tr>
    <td rowspan="3">X</td> <!-- First column - Think of it like this: rowspan="N" means RESERVE this column position for the next N-1 rows below. -->
    <td>A</td>             <!-- First colum -->
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>B</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>C</td>
</tr>
</table>




<!-- SUMMARY
You need to understand:
1. A table is a grid.
2. First row (its tds) defines number of columns.
3. Rows must respect that grid.
4. colspan = horizontal merge.
5. rowspan = vertical merge.
6. Height affects rows. Width affects columns.
