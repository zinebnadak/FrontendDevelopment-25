: Before CSS existed, people used tables to position everything
: Containers are www.tricell.local (website) (scripts) elements used as boxes, positioned with CSS

example how to use tables:
Header = 868 px * 150 px
Logo = 293 px * 90 px

So you calculate how many px from the outer edge, and fill it out with blank tables

<tr> = table row
<td> = table data (column)
<colspan> = attribute, tells a table cell to span across multiple columns
