IT25-22 Internal Website

Description:
This folder contains my actual course project: a complete internal (intranet-style) website for the fictional company Tricell. The website is not published online; instead, it consists of local HTML files that link to each other.

Goal:
To build a multi-page internal company website using classic HTML techniques, based on the requirements from my teacher.

Pages included:
- ✅index.html (welcome page)
- ✅ITXX-01.html, ITXX-02.html, etc. (employee profiles)
- personnel_registry.html
- company_presentation.html
- history.html
- board_of_directors.html

Requirements implemented:
- Header with social media icons and contact information
- Navigation menu under the header
- Back button leading to index.html
- Section titles moved inside the info-box layout
- Removal of green bars from the teacher’s original template
- Updated info pages with real content

HTML learning goals:
- Working with classic HTML layouts using <table> and <font>
- Understanding how sites were built before CSS
- Managing images, links, attributes, and multi-page structure

Notes:
This is the live version of the website that I customize, fill with content, and hand in as the final assignment.
